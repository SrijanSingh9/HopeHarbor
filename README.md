# Project Hope Harbor

Welcome to Project Hope Harbor! We're on a quest to create a map of kindness, and we need your help to light the way! üåü Imagine a world where everyone has access to the essentials of life: clean water to quench their thirst, nourishing food to fuel their bodies, and safe shelter to rest their heads.

## Our Journey So Far

As beginners in the world of tech and social impact, we've embarked on a journey to learn and create using Flutter and other Google tech stacks. Along the way, we've encountered challenges and triumphs, but our passion for making a difference keeps us going strong.
